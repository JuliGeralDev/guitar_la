- Custom styles in `app.css`, including responsive design with media queries.  
- CSS variables for consistent design across components.  

## 🖼️ Images

- All images are stored in the `img/` directory, including product photos and blog illustrations.

2. Start Apache using XAMPP or similar tool.  
3. Open your browser and navigate to:  
   `http://localhost/guitar_la/`

## 📝 Notes
